## Do NOT exclude Django apps from build context
# The `documents` and `workflows` packages are Django apps used at build time
# (e.g., during `manage.py collectstatic`). Excluding them breaks imports.

## previously excluded (re-enable):
# documents
# workflows

## If you need to shrink context, prefer excluding only large data subfolders
## inside these apps, not the packages themselves.

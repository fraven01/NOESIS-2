# Routing table for embedding profiles used by the RAG vector store.
#
# The router selects a profile deterministically based on tenant, process
# context and document class. The default profile must always be defined and
# every override must reference an existing embedding profile identifier.
#
# Duplicate selectors that point to the same profile are tolerated and will
# emit a `ROUTE_DUP_SAME_TARGET` warning to highlight redundant entries.
# Selectors are normalised to lowercase during validation and routing so
# `review`, `Review` and `REVIEW` are treated identically.
#
# Operators can override this file via the RAG_ROUTING_RULES_PATH setting.

# Backlog (prioritized)

This is a curated list of open work items for vibe-coding execution.
Top-to-bottom order within each section is priority order.
Prefer linking each item to concrete code paths (and optionally to an issue).

## Next up (highest leverage)
- [ ] Review later: framework analysis graph convergence (`ai_core/graphs/business/framework_analysis_graph.py`)

## Code Quality & Architecture Cleanup (Pre-MVP Refactoring)

### P0 - Critical Quick Wins (High Impact, Medium-High Effort)


### Docs/Test touchpoints (checklist)

### P1 - High Value Cleanups (Low-Medium Effort)

- [ ] **Activate AgenticChunker LLM Boundary Detection**: Implement `_detect_boundaries_llm()` in `ai_core/rag/chunking/agentic_chunker.py:354-379` (~25 LOC). Infrastructure complete (prompt template, Pydantic models, rate limiter, fallback logic). Needed to improve fallback quality for long documents (`token_count > max_tokens`). Details: `ai_core/rag/chunking/README.md#agentic-chunking`.

- [ ] **Simplify Adaptive Chunking Toggles (deferred post-MVP)**: Keep only two flags and one "new" path. Deferred because current flexibility benefits future use cases. Review after production experience shows which flags are unused. (pointers: `ai_core/rag/chunking/hybrid_chunker.py`, `ai_core/rag/chunking/late_chunker.py`, `ai_core/rag/chunking/README.md`)

### P2 - Long-term Improvements (High Effort)

- [ ] **Recursive Chunking for Long Documents**: Replace truncation fallback (`text[:2048]` in `late_chunker.py:1002`) with recursive chunking. When `token_count > max_tokens`, split into sections and chunk each section independently with proper boundary detection instead of hard truncation. (pointers: `ai_core/rag/chunking/late_chunker.py:984-1023`)

- [ ] **Robust Sentence Tokenizer**: Current splitting is fragile (`text.split(".")`) – breaks on abbreviations ("Dr."), decimals ("3.14"), URLs. Extract shared tokenizer to `ai_core/rag/chunking/utils.py` using regex with negative lookahead or `nltk.sent_tokenize`. (pointers: `agentic_chunker.py:347`, `late_chunker.py` sentence splitting)

### Observability Cleanup


### Hygiene

- [ ] **Extract Chunker Utils**: Deduplicate shared logic between `LateChunker` and `AgenticChunker` into `ai_core/rag/chunking/utils.py`: sentence splitting, chunk ID generation (`_build_adaptive_chunk_id`), token counting. (pointers: `late_chunker.py`, `agentic_chunker.py`)

## Semantics / IDs

## Layering / boundaries

## Externalization readiness (later)

- [ ] Graph registry: add versioning + request/response model metadata (note: factory support already exists via `LazyGraphFactory`)


## Observability / operations


## Agent navigation (docs-only drift)

## Hygiene (lowest priority)

- [ ] Documentation hygiene: remove encoding artifacts in docs/strings (purely textual)

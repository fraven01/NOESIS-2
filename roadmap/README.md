# Roadmaps and backlog (`roadmap/`)

This directory contains planning documents. It is not a source of runtime truth; behavior and contracts are defined in code.

## Index

- Architecture consolidation: `roadmap/architecture-consolidation-2025.md`
- Backlog (open items): `roadmap/backlog.md`

## Suggested conventions (optional)

- Every backlog/roadmap item includes links to concrete code paths (and optionally an issue link).
- `roadmap/backlog.md` is the only “what’s next” queue; other files here are explanatory planning notes.
- Traceability rule: approved breaking changes still get a `roadmap/backlog.md` item (with code pointers + acceptance criteria).
- Execution tracking lives in Issues/Projects; this folder is the curated “what/why” overview.
- Pre-MVP note: breaking changes (incl. DB/schema resets) are acceptable while iterating toward MVP.
